With the help of programming, this problem is a fairly simple one to solve

However one must ask "Is it possible with pure math"
As per the pdf, the answer seems to be yes...

In a way the mahematical solution is also fairly straightforward
though I do not yet posses the tools to perceive such solutions, and as such
it is difficult to know in which way to orient my thinking.

Arithmetic progressions must be looked into further,
additionally it would be helpful to know what kind of problem they are used to solve
and how they can help in my future programming endeavors

As I have learned recently, the fastest way to solve an iterative problem is to know the solution
I shall sleep on this and come back later to this problem


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Back to this, here's is my attempt at making a math based solution,
though I did look at the pdf, I hope to develop te intuition necessary to one day be able to solve these
without looking at the pdf or being pointed in the right direction

This can be broken down to the sum of all multiple of 3 plus the sum of all multiple of 5 minus the sum of all multiples of 15
(as 3 x 5 = 15 , multiples of 15 are also multiples of 3 and 5 and will have been counted twice)

Since finding the sum of all multiples of a number is the same equation no matter the number, I will demonstrate with 3

First we find how many multiples we will need to add, in our case, all the ones under 1000. We find that the larges multiple of 3 under 1000
is 999. 999 / 3 is 333.333... rounded down to 333. This is the amount of multiples under 1000

The multiples of 3 is an arithmeic progression with a difference of 3. The nth term of an arithmetic progression can be found with the following:

Xn = Xi + Mn where Xi is the first number of the progression, M is the common difference and n is the termn number\

In our case:
Xi = 3
M = 3
n = 333
Xn = 999

It follows that the sum of all these numbers can be expressed as :

S = Xi + (Xi + M) + (Xi + 2M) + ... (Xi + (n - 1)M)

or

S = Xn + (Xn - (n - 1)M) + (Xn - (n - 2)M) + ... (Xn - (n ))

Let's translate this to real numbers  and cap this at 12, or 4 iterations:

S = 3 + (3 + 3) + (3 + 6) + (3 + 9)
S = 12 + (12 - 3) + (12 - 6) + (12 - 9)

As it is now apparent, some terms here cancel if we add these two equations leaving us with:

2S = 3 + 12 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12

We can see that we end up with 4 3s and 4 12s, 4 being the maximum n, we can conver this to:

2S = 3n + 12n
S = (3n + 12n) / 2 or S = (3 + 12)n / 2

S = (Si + Sn)n / 2

Then we apply this formula to 3, 5 and 15, and we get our result
