With the help of programming, this problem is a fairly simple one to solve

However one must ask "Is it possible with pure math"
As per the pdf, the answer seems to be yes...

In a way the mahematical solution is also fairly straightforward
though I do not yet posses the tools to perceive such solutions, and as such
it is difficult to know in which way to orient my thinking.

Arithmetic progressions must be looked into further,
additionally it would be helpful to know what kind of problem they are used to solve
and how they can help in my future programming endeavors

As I have learned recently, the fastest way to solve an iterative problem is to know the solution
I shall sleep on this and come back later to this problem
